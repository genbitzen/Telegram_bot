- Having worked on an internship for the past few months. i hope to create a series of mini projects to help me revise the different language that i am supposedly able to do. 
- Following my interest, i decide to create a telegram bot, 
  exploiting its various features such as holding a conversation, interactive inline keyboards, provding real time information, etc. 
- <END GOAL> deploying it on the server. *look up heroku.
